* SerialOSnoopy

SerialOSnoopy is a mod of the serialosc abstraction that pipes all press data out on a secondary osc port.  This gives you the ability to pipe monome data into multiple application to monitor input such as processing, super collider, or even another instance of max/msp.

Utilizing the mod is fairly easy.  First copy the serialosnoopy.maxpat file into any monome application folder.  Open the application and modify the patcher file from serialosc.maxpat to serialoscnoopy.maxpat.

There should now be a new S button available within the serialosc subpatcher, click it to set the port

*NOTE* Routed osc data is sent without a prefix, this will allow you to make open ended applications that can receive the SerialOSnoopy data from any application without needing modification
