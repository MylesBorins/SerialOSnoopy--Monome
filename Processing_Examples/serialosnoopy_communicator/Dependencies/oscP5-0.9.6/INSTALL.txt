Where do I find my Processing sketchbook folder?
You can find the location of your sketchbook in the 
Preferences menu item inside your Processing application.
By default the following locations are used:
for mac users the sketchbook folder is located inside ~/Documents/Processing. 
for windows users the sketchbook folder is located 
inside folder 'My Documents'/Processing

in the following folder structure, Processing refers to your 
sketchbook folder. Put library oscP5 into the 'libraries' folder 
inside your sketchbook folder. 
if folder 'libraries does not exist, create it.
