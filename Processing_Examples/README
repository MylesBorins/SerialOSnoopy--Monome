In this folder you will find a variety of examples that utilize processing and SerialOSnoopy.  The majority of these examples will be modified examples from public projects unless noted otherwise.

I will do my best to give credit where credit is due, but if you feel that I have used your code without proper credit, please contact me and I promise to make the situation right.
